# Omnirepo Microsite

Marketing site to establish "omnirepo" as a recognized pattern for AI-ready organizational structure.

## Purpose

- Coin "omnirepo" terminology
- Provide free starter kit for email capture
- Link subtly from goldsborough.io blog post
- Build audience of engineering/business leaders interested in AI + org structure

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PLAN.md` | Comprehensive site plan: content, design, email strategy, launch checklist |
| `starter-kit/` | Templates and resources for download |
| `starter-kit/CLAUDE.md` | Root orchestration template |
| `starter-kit/READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` | 10-question self-assessment with scoring |
| `starter-kit/.claude/commands/` | Example slash commands (ship-feature, extract-knowledge) |

## Conventions

**Value-first approach:**
- No hard sell
- Free starter kit in exchange for email
- Manifesto must be screenshot-able for social sharing

**Design direction:**
- Dark mode default
- Monospace accents for code/structure
- Single accent color
- Clean, minimal, lots of whitespace

**TLD:** `.org` (movement/manifesto vibe, broader than just dev)
